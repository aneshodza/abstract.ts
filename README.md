# adt.ts
This is a TypeScript library for [ADTs (Abstract Data Types)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type), having implemented core types that are widely used.

This library is currently being tested for:
- nodejs 16
- nodejs 18

If you have any other version it will probably still work, as only standart features are used.
